    <p>when break was to going to start there was an unknown excitement as a new student to diffrent place 
       in ottawa and canada so me and my friends planned two trips one to toronto second to montreal we really enjoyed
    a lot and had fun clicked too many pictues and tasted canadian food that was amazing and from third week i started my job and
     started reviewing 1st semester syllabus but overall it was fun. I really enjoyed semester break</p>
