I created my website or using only simple HTML and CSS I did not use any additional framework like. First of all I try to build my website using framework because it is easy to use and one can make a website easily last time using Boot Camp but I struggled a little bit with bullshit while making my website that’s why I changed my mind and I made my website by using flex box and grid As I am confident in that because from the long time I’m using grid and flex box only so I skip the plan of bullshit and I am having with less knowledge for JavaScript so obviously it so I will not be using it JavaScript in my website other than this I feel used some problems in great also but however I solved that problems and I struggle a lot in first week when you gave me the assignment because if you remember I show you the grid with the sharp edges in my portfolio so I struggle not while making that so I can use that in my user experience assignment and made an easy grid for me and that was a problem with phased in first weekend after that it was easy for me to do the website other than this I’ll show you my word like the banners which one I meet I mean on my own to show in my portfolio and it was my work when I was learning graphic designing so it was a study work And other than this I have taken some pictures from unsplash.com which is a stock website given by the college And For extra creativity are used to animations in my website which I created last time like the bounce effect and the image zoom in. And i have provided my mockup (prototype) as a pdf in asset folder.
